# FullStack

An app to track high school basketball players statistics. Users will be able to see the top five players in points, rebounds, steals and assists on the homepage. The top 20 ranked players are listed when selecting one of categories.

Users are able to sign up to add their team to their app. Once they sign up, they will have an account that allows them to add their players. They will be able to see all the players on their roster to update or delete. I have yet to add the update feature but I will.

This app was created using React / JavaScript, C#, API database and SQL.
